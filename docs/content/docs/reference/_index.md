# Language Reference

This section contains a comprehensive reference of the entire Slow programming language.

Some (not all) of the examples below use the interpreter format. In this format, statements are prefixed with `->`, the interpreter prompt. If a statement takes up multiple lines, all lines after the first will be prefixed with `..`. This format mimicks the Slow interpreter.

```
# This is the non-interpreter format
var x = 2
print(x)
```

```
-> # This is the interpreter format
-> var x = 2
2
-> print(x)
2
```
